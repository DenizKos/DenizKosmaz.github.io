                <h3>My Journey to Programming</h3>
                <p>My name is Deniz Kosmaz, and I'm 20 years old. I've had a passion for technology from a very young age, starting when I got my first computer at the age of 7, which had a modest 1 GB of RAM and an old Intel processor. I spent a significant amount of my time gaming during my school years, and while I did reasonably well academically, I was particularly strong in mathematics. However, my gaming interests often overshadowed my academic pursuits.

                    My first significant exposure to the world of technology and programming came during my technical high school, where I studied subjects like SQL, C#, and digitalization. Unfortunately, the school's resources were limited, and I had to teach myself a lot of the material. This experience led me to realize my true passion for programming, even though my school experiences were less than ideal.</p>

                <h3>A Shift in My Career Path</h3>
                <p>Around two years ago, I began an apprenticeship in IT system management, but I quickly discovered that I didn't have the enthusiasm for selling IT products. Instead, I found my passion in sports during this time. It was then that I had an epiphany â€“ what would happen if I gave up gaming and pursued a career as a front-end developer, with the ultimate goal of becoming a full-stack developer? I always knew I had a talent for programming, but I had been too lazy to truly harness it.

                    I made the decision to set aside gaming entirely and created a schedule that involved learning for a minimum of 8 hours each day. What might sound like an intense commitment was, in fact, a comfortable routine for me. I prioritized good sleep, nutrition, and regular exercise, visiting the gym four times a week. I researched the most effective student learning and break patterns and applied them to my schedule.</p>

                <h3>Embracing My New Path</h3>
                <p>Within just two days, I had learned HTML, and four days later, I had a solid grasp of CSS. With this knowledge, I've already started building my own designed website. While I'm at the beginning of my journey, and my code might still be a bit messy, I want to showcase the immense potential within me. I am committed to maximizing my talent by maintaining a healthy body and mind through my organization skills and perseverance.

                    Of course, these seven days were a rollercoaster ride. Even designing a single button brought me moments of self-doubt and required extensive research. However, my determination to see any project through to the end is unwavering. I despise leaving anything unfinished.
                    
                    So, what sets me apart from others, and what more can I prove to you? Well, aside from telling you that you need me on your team, I believe my passion, dedication, and rapid learning are what make me stand out. I'm ready to take on any challenge and grow as a developer.</p>
